Payment - Payment will be sent to seller of the reservation via the paypal address they provided when they set up your Vacancy Travel account within 1 business day after the check-in date of their new reservation. There is nothing for the hotel to do regarding payment.  If the either party has any questions about this please refer them to contact Vacancy Travel.
